1. Open MS-Paint. Resize the canvas to size 1366x768. (Although you can give any size because game automatically adjusts to the map size,
1366x768 will be used in the competition).
2. Mark water with Blue Color (RGB = 0,0,255)
3. Mark land with Green Color (RGB = 0,255,0)
4. To mark fish in a region, just randomly stroke that region with a white (255,255,255) brush.
   The mean of those connected white points will be treated as a fish location.
5. To mark player1's spawn area, randomly stroke the desired region with red (255,0,0) brush.
6. Player2's spawn area can be similarly marked with yellow (255,255,0) brush.
7. Save the image as a 24 color bitmap (.bmp).
8. To launch the game with the map, open it with the game executable, by "Right Click on map -> Open With -> Choose default program".
Notes:
-> All other colors will be treated as water by the application.
-> Illogical/Improper/Corrupt markings can/will lead to undefined behaviour.
